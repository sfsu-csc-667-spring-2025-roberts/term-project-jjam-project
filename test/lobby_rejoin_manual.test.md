// Test for lobby rejoin button rendering
// This is a placeholder for a UI integration test. In a real setup, use a tool like Jest + Puppeteer or Cypress.
// For now, this is a manual test instruction:

/*
1. Start the server and log in as a test user.
2. Join or create a game, then return to the lobby.
3. Confirm that a 'Rejoin' button appears for the active game.
4. Click 'Rejoin' and verify you are redirected to the correct game with the correct state loaded.
